**Berlioz** is a service that delivers microservices applications to AWS public cloud. Application components are defined in YAML using high level abstractions. This enables teams work independently and focus on the business problems and not cloud logistics. **Berlioz** will also configure AWS native services like DynamoDB, Kinesis, etc.

Another very useful capability of **Berlioz** is to deploy the application locally on a workstation as if it is running in an AWS cloud. This will also work even if the application is using cloud native resources and services. This significantly improves development team productivity.
