Builds Docker images for current project.

Should be used from the root directory of the project.
Can be used to build images for one or multiple clusters.

The tool will be searching for service definitions in **Berliozfile** files
within the current directory. It will then build **Dockerfile** files in the same
directory.

```
cluster_one/
    Berliozfile        # Definition of the cluster_one
    service_one/
        Berliozfile    # Definition of the service_one
        Dockerfile
    service_two/
        Berliozfile    # Definition of the service_two
        Dockerfile
```
