Builds and pushes the images to the cloud.

Executes the ${command:build} command and once the build is complete, pushes the
images to the cloud. It is important to note that this command does not deploy
the software version. It only makes it available for one click deployment.

To deploy the cluster refer to ${command:run} command.

Just like with the ${command:build} command, this command should be called from the
project root directory.
