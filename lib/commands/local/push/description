Builds and pushes the images to local workstation store.

Executes the ${command:build} command and once the build is complete, pushes the
images to the local workstation store.
It is important to note that this command does not deploy the cluster locally yet.
To deploy the cluster use the ${command:local provision} command.

Just like with the ${command:build} command, this command should be called from the
project root directory.
