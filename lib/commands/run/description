Run the cluster on the cloud.

The name of the deployment definition should be specified.

Optionally a cluster and region can be specified to limit the deployment scope,
otherwise all clusters would be deployed to all regions included in the deployment
definition. Please note that the changes will be made to the specified deployment
only. Any other deployment definition will be unchanged.

The command will preview the changes to be made and trigger deployment process.
To monitor the process refer to ${command:status} command.

Also, once the deployment is fully up and running you can access the public endpoints
using ${command:endpoints} command.
